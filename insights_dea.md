Here's the dashboard of the DEA database analysis. The DEA database "tracks the path of every single pain pill sold in the United States â€” by manufacturers and distributors to pharmacies in every town and city".

In my analysis through ArcGIS Insights, I created a **link map** to represent the distribution path between the distributors and pharmacies. where the width of the link reflects the sum of dosage units. In addition, there're 2 tables showing how many people live within five miles of the location of these pharmacies (buyers).
