Welcome to [The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project](https://pittsburghneighborhoodproject.blog/)'s Heat Inequity Map, an interactive tool that sheds light on the unequal distribution of heat in Pittsburgh's neighborhoods. Using land surface temperature (LST) data from the hottest season between 2010 and 2019, we analyzed temperature differences between neighborhoods, taking into account both existing patterns of disadvantage and land surface cover factors. Our goal is to raise awareness about the issue of heat inequity and to provide insights that can help inform policy and community action. 

Explore our latest interactive dashboard to understand the disparity in urban heat across Pittsburgh's neighborhoods.

# Conclusion

Overall, To address heat inequity in Pittsburgh, there are several strategies that can be implemented, such as increasing the number of green spaces, implementing cool roofs and pavements. It's also important to address the root causes of heat inequity, such as social and economic inequalities, and to involve community members in the decision-making process. 

While growth and development may bring positive changes to some formerly redlined communities, such as Strip District and Lawrenceville, it's important to address the underlying systemic inequalities that continue to impact these neighborhoods and to ensure that efforts to address heat inequity are centered on equity and justice for all residents.
