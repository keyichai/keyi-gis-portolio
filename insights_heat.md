Welcome to [The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project](https://pittsburghneighborhoodproject.blog/)'s Heat Inequity Map. Using the average land surface temperature (LST) during the hottest season from 2010 to 2019, I analyzed the temperature differences between communities. It's important to address the root causes of heat inequity, such as social and economic inequalities, and to involve community members in the decision-making process. 

Explore our latest interactive dashboard to understand the disparity in urban heat across Pittsburgh's neighborhoods.
