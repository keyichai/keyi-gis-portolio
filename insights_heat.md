Welcome to [The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Project](https://pittsburghneighborhoodproject.blog/)'s Heat Inequity Map. Using the average land surface temperature (LST) during the hottest season from 2010 to 2019, I analyzed the temperature differences between the existing patterns of disadvantaged communities. 

The land surface cover is the most significate factor that influence the LST, such as impervious surface and tree canopy.  the relationships between temperatures and impervious surface percentage and tree canopies by neighborhoods

Explore our latest interactive dashboard to understand the disparity in urban heat across Pittsburgh's neighborhoods.
