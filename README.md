# keyi-gis-portolio
This is my portfolio for Advanced GIS, I'm a second-year Master of Urban Design with a 5-year Bachelor of Urban Planning in China. Now I'm working as a research assistant for Smart Surfaces for Climate and Health project, focusing on mapping land surface temperature using Landsat.
I hope to learn more about GIS project management, spatial data science during this class. And I hope to explore my future career path as a urban designer/urban data analyst.
