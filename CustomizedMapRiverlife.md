- Color palette
The **color palette** I used was extracted via Canva which perfectly matches the Riverlife website.

Here's how I made my design decisions:

1. In the **Google Maps Styling Wizard**, I started with a **standard** theme that matched the overall style I wanted to emulate in the map.
2. I changed the color of the water to #2b6376. By doing so, I emphasized the body of water and reduced the weight of vehicular traffic in the map by changing the color of the roads to white to highlight the green spaces and pedestrian system along the river. At the same time, I applied the green color from the palette to other ground features such as man-made landscapes (Aqua Haza #e9f2f0).
3. To make the attractions on the river stand out, I chose to hide some labels for non-public attractions and improve the font style by adding borders and changing the color of the font fill (Tussock #c98d3a for Neighborhood labels) to highlight the parks and trails along the river.

Overall, I redesigned the base image to be less saturated, in order to better highlight bodies of water and riverlife-related items

I redesigned the map to use the same color scheme as the Riverlife icon to match the style of the entire webpage; in addition, I emphasized the color of the water bodies and reduced the weight of vehicular traffic in the map by changing the color of roads to white, in order to highlight the green space and pedestrian system along the river.
