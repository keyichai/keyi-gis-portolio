- **Color palette**

The color palette I used was extracted via Canva which perfectly matches the Riverlife website.

- **Here's how I made my design decisions:**

1. In the **Google Maps Styling Wizard**, I started with the Standard theme that matched the overall style I wanted to emulate in the map.
2. I changed the color of the water to #2b6376. By doing so, I emphasized the body of water and reduced the weight of vehicular traffic in the map by changing the color of the roads to white to highlight the green spaces and pedestrian system along the river. At the same time, I applied the green color from the palette to other ground features such as man-made landscapes (Aqua Haza #e9f2f0).
3. To make the attractions on the river stand out, I chose to hide some labels for non-public attractions and improve the font style by adding borders and changing the color of the font fill (Tussock #c98d3a for Neighborhood labels) to highlight the parks and trails along the river.

Overall, I redesigned the base image to be less saturated, in order to better highlight bodies of water and riverlife-related items
